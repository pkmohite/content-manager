# CLAUDE.md - Content Manager

Generate ultra-high quality LinkedIn posts with viral potential about AI sales intelligence.

**Focus: 1-2 posts per week maximum, ultra-high quality only**

## Quick Start

```
Create LinkedIn post about [TOPIC] for [sales leaders/PMMs/founders]
```

## Content Sourcing Strategy

**Before creating content, use web search to find:**
- Recent industry discussions and pain points
- Trending topics in AI sales/conversation intelligence  
- Underground insights from forums (Reddit, HackerNews, industry Slack channels)
- Contrarian takes that challenge conventional wisdom
- Specific data and statistics that support frameworks
- Customer conversation patterns and real implementation stories

**Search Examples (Based on High-Performing Content Themes):**
- "conversation intelligence problems" OR "call recording waste" site:reddit.com
- "AI sales tools don't work" OR "sales AI failed implementation" 
- "PMM messaging ignored by sales" OR "sales enablement materials unused"
- "voice of customer surveys vs reality" competitive intelligence insights
- "AI-powered vs AI-first" architectural differences and limitations
- Recent industry discussions about strategy-execution gaps in B2B
- Customer conversation insights vs traditional market research debates

## Content Rules

### Before Writing
1. Check `CONTENT-MASTER-INDEX.md` for similar topics
2. Check `content/drafts/ideas-backlog.md` for topic status  
3. **Review `references/` for posts from popular influencers, and some of my past posts and their performance (from high to low performers)

### LinkedIn Posts Only (300-500 words)
**Ultra-High Quality Standards:**
- **Must have**: Specific data/statistics OR original framework OR contrarian insight
- **Must have**: High shareability (frameworks, tools, counterintuitive insights)
- **No hashtags**, no formulaic questions, **NO MARKDOWN FORMATTING** (LinkedIn doesn't support bold, bullet points should be plain text with â€¢)
- **Target**: RevOps (20%), PMMs (30%), Sales Leaders (20%), Product Managers (15%), Founders (15%)
- **Viral potential**: Ask "Would I bookmark/share this with my team?"
