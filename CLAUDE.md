## File Naming Conventions

### **Content Files**
- Blog posts: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-keywords-BLOG-READY.md`
- LinkedIn posts: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-keywords-LINKEDIN-READY.md`
- Use intended publication date
- 2-4 descriptive keywords separated by hyphens

### **Content References**
- Blog posts: B001, B002, B003...
- LinkedIn posts: L001, L002, L003...
- Used in master index and ideas backlog for cross-referencing

## Anti-Duplication System

### **Mandatory Checks Before Content Creation**
1. Search CONTENT-MASTER-INDEX.md for similar keywords
2. Review ideas-backlog.md for topic usage status
3. Check content relationship mapping for overlaps
4. Validate unique differentiation if similar content exists

### **Red Flag Warnings**
- Exact keyword match with existing content
- Same audience + same theme + same content depth
- Framework overlap with existing structure
- Recent coverage within 30 days

## Success Metrics

### **Content Portfolio Health**
- Balanced distribution across content pillars
- Diverse audience targeting without oversaturation
- Zero exact content duplications
- Strategic differentiation in all pieces

### **Content Quality Indicators**

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** reference deprecated instruction files (blog-instructions.md, CLAUDE-CONTENT-GENERATOR.md, templates)
- **ALWAYS** complete anti-duplication protocol before content creation
- **NEVER** skip post-creation tracking updates
- **ENSURE** every piece advances strategic business objectives
