## About

I am an enthusiast in **Strategy, Growth, and Technology** with a passion for innovative and disruptive technologies with a focus on **AI/ML**. My experience lies mainly at the intersection of **product and software development**. You'll find me either developing full-stack applications for early-stage/growth teams or leading product teams.

At Proponent, we've built an AI-powered conversational intelligence platform that extracts customer pain points and competitive insights, then organizes them by persona characteristics—enabling truly targeted messaging that resonates with each unique buyer.

📩 Are you a product marketer or B2B founder who's using Clay to enrich your leads but unsure if your ICP filters are capturing the right prospects in the first place? I think the answer is in your sales call transcripts. Reach out to learn more or to just chat!
