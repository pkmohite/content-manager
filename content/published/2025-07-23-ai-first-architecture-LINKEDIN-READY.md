After a 2-week break from posting, I've been reflecting on what I'm seeing in the market.

There's a crucial difference between AI-powered and AI-first that will determine which B2B companies survive the next 5 years.

AI-powered = Retrofit  
Adding machine learning to existing systems. Like putting a smart doorbell on a 1975 house—functional, but fundamentally limited.

AI-first = Rebuild  
Architecting every component with AI at the core. The difference isn't just technical—it's philosophical.

When we built Proponent, we chose the harder path: AI-first architecture.

The result? Our platform comprehends conversations, not just transcribes them. It understands relationships between customer needs, product features, and sales outcomes that would be impossible with retrofitted AI.

Quick evaluation framework for any B2B tool:
1. Was AI integrated after the core system was built? (AI-powered)
2. Was the entire system designed around AI capabilities? (AI-first)
3. Can it do things impossible without AI at the foundation?

The next wave of B2B software will be defined by this choice. Companies retrofitting AI will hit performance ceilings. Companies built AI-first will be unconstrained.

What AI-first capabilities do you think will become table stakes in your industry?
