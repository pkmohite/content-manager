Stop asking customers what they want.

Start listening to what they actually say when they think you're not paying attention.

Customer interviews lie. Focus groups perform. Surveys get gamed.

But sales calls? Sales calls are raw truth.

When a prospect says "we need better efficiency" in a survey, that's useless.

When they say "I'm spending 12 hours a week on compliance reports and I'm terrified we're going to get audited" in a sales call, that's product roadmap gold.

The difference: Context. Emotion. Specificity. Stakes.

Traditional customer research optimizes for what people think they should say. Sales conversations capture what people actually feel.

Your best product insights aren't hiding in research reports. They're hiding in your CRM call notes.

The companies that figure this out will build products customers actually need instead of products customers think they want.
