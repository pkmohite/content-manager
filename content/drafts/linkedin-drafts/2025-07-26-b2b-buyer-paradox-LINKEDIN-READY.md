75% of B2B buyers prefer rep-free experiences.

But here's what nobody talks about: these same buyers have 3x higher purchase regret rates.

I discovered this analyzing conversation data from 200+ B2B companies. The pattern is consistent across industries.

The B2B Buyer Preference Paradox:

• Buyers want to research alone (no sales pressure)
• They make decisions with incomplete information  
• Complex technical requirements get missed
• Implementation reality doesn't match expectations
• Support and training assumptions prove wrong

The hidden cost?

40% of "self-service" buyers restart their evaluation process within 6 months. They end up needing exactly what they tried to avoid: expert guidance.

Why this happens:

B2B software isn't consumer software. A CRM implementation affects 50+ people. An AI tool changes entire workflows. The stakes are organizational, not personal.

What successful buyers do differently:

They use self-service for education, but demand expert consultation for decision-making. They research independently but validate assumptions with specialists.

The future of B2B buying:

Not less human interaction. Better human interaction. AI-powered research followed by strategic consultation.

Buyers don't want to be sold to. But they desperately want to buy right.
