My father spent 30 years as a procurement executive, evaluating multi-million dollar software purchases for one of India's largest conglomerates.

Last week, I asked him: "What do sales teams get wrong about enterprise buyers?"

His answer will change how you think about B2B sales.

"The vendor shortlist is decided before any sales call happens."

Here's what he told me about how enterprise procurement actually works:

The Real Enterprise Evaluation Process:

Phase 1: Internal Problem Definition (Weeks 1-4)
• Finance, operations, and compliance define requirements
• Informal conversations with current vendors and consultants
• Industry peer networks share recommendations and warnings
• Budget parameters set based on "similar companies spend X"

Phase 2: Shadow Research (Weeks 5-12)
• Research team builds detailed vendor comparison spreadsheets
• Reference calls with existing customers (vendors never hear about these)
• Legal and security teams eliminate vendors on compliance
• Procurement creates "approved vendor" shortlist of 2-3 companies

Phase 3: Vendor Theater (Weeks 13-16)
• Demos and presentations to validate predetermined decisions
• Price negotiations (but choice is already made)
• Due diligence paperwork and contract discussions
• Purchase order issued to preferred vendor

"By the time you get the first sales call, 80% of our evaluation is complete."

The brutal truth: Most B2B sales efforts focus on Phase 3, when the real decision happened in Phases 1-2.

What sales teams miss:

• The compliance manager who eliminates vendors before sales ever sees them
• The peer network conversations that happen at industry conferences
• The consultant who has informal influence over the decision
• The finance team's "budget reality" vs. the "budget they share with vendors"

My father's advice to vendors: "Stop trying to sell during demos. Start trying to influence during the invisible research phase."

This is why I'm building Proponent around conversation intelligence. The visible sales process is just the final act of a much longer play.

Most conversation intelligence tools capture the theater. The real insights come from understanding the performance that happened before anyone called "action."

Sales teams are optimizing for Act 3 of a play that started months ago.
