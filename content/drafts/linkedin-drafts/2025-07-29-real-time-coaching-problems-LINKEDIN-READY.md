Real-time AI coaching is failing because we're solving the wrong problem.

Sales reps don't need a teleprompter during calls. They need better strategy before calls.

I've watched sales teams implement "AI coaching" tools that suggest what to say in real-time. The result? Robotic conversations that prospects immediately recognize as scripted.

Meanwhile, these same teams have zero insights about:
• Which pain points actually resonate with their market
• How successful deals differ from lost ones  
• What objections signal genuine interest vs. polite rejection
• When prospects are ready to buy vs. still researching

We're optimizing for tactical prompting when we should be optimizing for strategic intelligence.

Stop trying to make reps better actors. Start making them better strategists.

The future of sales AI isn't about what to say during the call. It's about knowing what the call should accomplish before you pick up the phone.
