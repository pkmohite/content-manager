I'm tired of AI sales tools that promise "plug-and-play" setup.

Nothing in enterprise software is plug-and-play. Nothing.

Your CRM data is messy. Your sales process is unique. Your customer language is specific to your industry.

Yet every AI vendor shows the same demo with perfectly clean data and generic use cases.

Then reality hits: 6 months of training, custom integrations, and dedicated resources you didn't budget for.

The companies that survive the AI sales tool shakeout won't be the ones with the slickest demos.

They'll be the ones honest enough to tell you it's going to be hard work.

Stop selling magic. Start selling reality.
