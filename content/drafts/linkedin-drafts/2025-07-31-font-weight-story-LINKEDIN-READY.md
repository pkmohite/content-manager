My co-founder and I spent 3 hours debating font weights last week.

For our conversation intelligence dashboard.

He wanted regular (400). I wanted medium (500).

Sounds ridiculous, right? 

But here's what we were really arguing about: Does our platform feel like a reporting tool or a strategic advisor?

Font weight 400 says "here's your data." Font weight 500 says "here's your intelligence."

Those 100 units of font weight represent our entire philosophy about AI.

Most conversation intelligence tools treat AI like a better search engine. Find keywords. Count mentions. Generate summaries.

We treat AI like a strategic partner. Understand context. Identify patterns. Recommend actions.

The font weight debate wasn't about typography. It was about whether our users see Proponent as another dashboard or as their competitive advantage.

We went with 500.

Details reveal philosophy. Philosophy drives product decisions. Product decisions determine whether users get value or just get data.

Even font weights matter when you're building something people will trust with their most important conversations.
