68% of sales reps admit to lying on their CRM updates.

I learned this from analyzing 2,000+ sales conversations where reps discussed their actual processes vs. what they report to management.

The disconnect is staggering:

CRM says: "Had great discovery call, identified 3 pain points, next step is technical demo"

Reality: "Prospect asked basic questions I couldn't answer, meeting ran 10 minutes over, they haven't responded to my follow-up"

This isn't a training problem. It's an incentive problem.

CRMs reward activity over outcomes. Quantity over quality. Process compliance over actual progress.

So reps optimize for what gets measured: logged calls, updated stages, forecasted revenue.

Meanwhile, the real intelligence - what prospects actually care about, which objections signal real interest, how buying decisions actually get made - gets lost in performance theater.

The solution isn't better CRM adoption. It's better intelligence capture.

When you can understand deal reality from conversation data instead of rep reporting, you stop needing reps to perform for the system.

You start getting real insights instead of sanitized updates.
