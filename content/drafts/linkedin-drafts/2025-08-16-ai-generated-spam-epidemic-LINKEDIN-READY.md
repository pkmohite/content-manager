Half the sales emails in my inbox are AI-generated.

And I can tell.

The dead giveaways:
• Perfect grammar with zero personality
• Generic "pain point" assumptions that miss the mark completely  
• Cookie-cutter structure that screams template
• Mentions "leveraging synergies" unironically
• References my company's "digital transformation journey" when we're a 12-person startup

But here's what worries me more than bad AI emails: The good ones.

I received an outreach email last month that was so perfectly personalized, so perfectly timed, and so perfectly written that I almost responded immediately.

Then I realized it was AI-generated. Not because it was bad, but because it was too good.

No human sales rep has time to research my recent LinkedIn posts, cross-reference them with my company's tech stack, and craft messaging that addresses my specific concerns about our Q4 hiring plans.

That level of personalization at scale is only possible with AI.

The AI email epidemic isn't about quality. It's about trust.

When every email could be AI-generated, how do prospects distinguish between authentic outreach and sophisticated automation?

When AI can perfectly mimic human writing, personality, and even humor, what makes human salespeople valuable?

The answer isn't better spam filters or AI detection tools.

It's radical transparency.

The sales teams winning in 2025 aren't hiding their AI usage - they're leading with it.

"Hi Sarah, our AI research suggests you might be interested in this because of your recent posts about scaling customer success. Here's why we think it's relevant..."

Authenticity in the AI age means being honest about using AI to be more thoughtful, not pretending to be human when you're not.

The future of sales isn't about fooling prospects with better AI.

It's about using AI to be genuinely more helpful.
