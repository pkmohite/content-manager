Your sales team records 50+ conversations every month. Each contains gold: customer pain points, feature requests, competitive insights, objections that could reshape your messaging.

But here's what actually happens: Call ends → Quick summary → Buried in CRM → Never seen again.

We call this the Strategy-to-Execution Gap.

It's the distance between what customers are telling you and what your teams are doing with that information. And it's costing you millions.

The Pattern I've Seen Across 100+ Companies:

• Marketing spends 3 months crafting buyer personas  
• Sales spends 100+ hours learning real customer needs  
• These intelligence streams never converge  
• GTM strategies built on assumptions, not evidence

Here's the brutal math:
- Average B2B company: 200 sales calls/month
- Average insights captured: 5% 
- Average insights acted upon: 1%
- 99% of customer intelligence is wasted

At Proponent, we're obsessed with closing this gap. Not through more meetings or better processes, but through technology that automatically synthesizes conversations into strategic intelligence.

The 3-Level Strategy-to-Execution Framework:

Level 1: Documentation (Where most companies stop)  
Record calls, write summaries, file away

Level 2: Analysis (Where good companies operate)  
Extract themes, track objections, identify patterns

Level 3: Synthesis (Where winning companies thrive)  
Turn conversation patterns into GTM strategy  
Automatic insight flow from customer voice to execution  
Evidence-based positioning that actually resonates

The breakthrough: When customer conversations become your primary source of market intelligence, strategy and execution finally align.

The companies that figure this out don't just win deals—they reshape entire markets based on what customers are actually saying.
