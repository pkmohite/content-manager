I smiled on a call with my co-founder Mathew Thekkadayil last week. We made a decision that would create hours of manual work for us, and I couldn't have been happier.

We were onboarding a new client who had a library of call recordings with their old provider. The easy path? Push them through our system automatically. Instead, we decided to process the first batch ourselves, by hand.

It sounds inefficient, but it's our most important quality check.

There's a myth in our industry that you just point an AI at a pile of data and magic comes out. The reality is that nuance is everything. A generic AI can easily identify a question like, "Do you have compliance features?" But it takes human oversight to understand the underlying pain point: "My team is spending weeks on manual audits and I'm worried about falling behind."

This "manual work" is our secret weapon. It's a commitment we made early on: never automate empathy. The goal isn't to be the smartest AI, but the most reliable.

It's exciting to see the new Gong and Clay integration bringing conversation intelligence directly into GTM workflows. Being able to pull insights from a sales call to personalize outreach for a lookalike account is a big leap forward for personalized outreach.

And it opens up an even bigger possibility.

What if we didn't just use one conversation to find the next similar deal? What if we could analyze ALL our conversations at once to see the patterns that define our entire market?

Finding out one prospect needs better compliance automation is a great sales signal. Discovering that 30% of your prospects in a key vertical are all struggling with the same compliance issue—that's a GTM strategy.

The first tells you how to win one deal.
The second tells you how to build the playbook that wins the category.

This is exactly the problem we're obsessed with at Proponent. We're building the system that enables GTM teams to go beyond the 1-to-1 tactic and unlock the 1-to-many strategic insights hiding across all their customer conversations.

I found myself in a surprisingly passionate, half-hour debate with our team a few weeks ago about font weights.

Our designers had used a specific "semi-bold" in Figma that wasn't rendering the same way in our live product. It was a tiny detail that 9 out of 10 users would likely never notice. The easy route was to just pick a new font and move on.

But we didn't. We dug in, researched the rendering issues, and found a solution.

It might sound silly to spend that much energy on something so small, but I realized it's a perfect metaphor for our entire philosophy. A founder I admire once said, "The way you do anything is the way you do everything."

If we're willing to obsess over getting a font right, it means we're willing to obsess over finding the nuance in a sales call. It means we care about the craft. This commitment to detail is what separates a good product from a great one, and it's a culture I'm incredibly proud we're building.

Let me know if this sounds familiar.

Customer says: "Our reporting takes too long."
Rep hears: "They need faster reports."
Real pain: "My CEO questions my team's impact every quarter because I can't show clear ROI."

Customer says: "We're drowning in manual processes."
Rep hears: "They need automation."
Real pain: "I'm losing my best people because they're burned out on busy work."

Customer says: "Our data is scattered everywhere."
Rep hears: "They need better integration."
Real pain: "I make million-dollar decisions based on gut feel because I can't trust our numbers."

We're treating symptoms, not the disease. The customer mentions the tactical problem because it's easy to articulate. But the real pain lives deeper. It's about credibility, confidence, and career risk.

Surface pain gets you a meeting. Deep pain gets you the deal.

A lot of marketing AI is built to give you the answer.
"Write this headline."
"Draft this messaging."

It wants to dictate strategy.

But the most effective GTM teams don't want AI to dictate strategy.
They want it to guide it.

There's a subtle but critical difference.
Dictating replaces the marketer's judgment.
Guiding augments it with context that's beyond human comprehension.

The goal isn't for AI to create the perfect message.
It's to give your PMMs the customer context so *they* can build it.

Ingeniuty is a human superpower that AI can NEVER replace.

RevOps leaders often focus with creating a "single source of truth."
They blame bad data on integrations, duplicates, or inconsistent fields.

The biggest source of bad data is fear.
A sales rep who inflates their pipeline is afraid of missing quota.
A marketer who reports on vanity metrics is afraid their campaigns aren't working.

The data in your CRM is a reflection of your culture.
If your team is afraid to tell the truth, your data will reflect that.

I was watching Andrej Karpathy's new talk on software, and his analogy for a key weakness of LLMs really hit home. He describes them as having "anterograde amnesia"—like a brilliant coworker whose memory resets every single morning. They have encyclopedic knowledge but no long-term context about your organization.

It made me think about how much strategic business knowledge suffers from the same problem. We analyze events in isolation—a single sales call, a quarterly report, a customer ticket. Each one provides a snapshot, but the insight is fleeting, and the context is lost by the next day.

You can't build a real strategy on a memory that constantly resets.

True understanding isn't found in one data point; it's built on the accumulated wisdom of ALL of them. It requires connecting a signal from a conversation in January with a pattern that emerges in June. It's about building a collective, long-term memory.

This is one of the most interesting challenges for anyone building products today. It's not just about what AI can do in a moment, but how we build systems that give it a memory.

Highly recommend the watch.

Everyone is rushing to replace their SDRs with AI.
It looks like a clever way to cut costs.

I predict we'll see a wave of SDR re-hiring by this time next year.

Because efficiency is not the same as connection.

An AI can send 1,000 emails.
But it can't build trust after a tough question.
It can't read the room and adjust its tone.
It can't hear a slight hesitation and uncover the real objection.

We're using AI to replace the human part of the sales process.
We should be using it to give our humans the intelligence to do their jobs better.

Got a blast from the past today. Four years ago, I was hiring for my sales enablement team at Locus.

Reading the post, I had to laugh at myself for using the term "growth ninjas." But then I reread this line: "passionate about bridging the gap between value-creators and value-seekers."

And it hit me. That's it. That's the same problem I'm still completely obsessed with today.

We've come a long way with Proponent, but the work continues.

Revenue leaders are obsessed with forecast accuracy.
They think it's a data problem.

It's a "team orchestration" problem.

You can have the most accurate pipeline data in the world. It won't close a single deal if your sellers can't handle a key objection or articulate value.

For years, RevOps data lived in one world, and sales coaching lived in another. There was no bridge between the insight and the action.

AI is that bridge. It connects what's happening on customer calls directly to what each seller needs to learn. It turns RevOps from a reporting function into a real-time engine to organize sales team's goals.

This piece from MarketingProfs gets into how this shift is happening. Worth the read.

Your sales playbook is where your best content goes to die.
I say that as someone who has built a lot of them.

We create detailed battlecards, case studies, and talk tracks.
We put them in a pristine library.
And then we wonder why reps don't use them.

The problem isn't the content.
It's the timing.

No one can find the right slide for the right objection in the middle of a live conversation.

The future of enablement isn't building a better library.
It's about delivering the right sentence at the right second.

Enablement isn't about access to information.
It's about the speed of retrieval.

I get my best competitive intelligence from our losses.
Not from analyst reports or fancy "deep research" tools.

When a deal is lost, the easy answer is price or a missing feature.
The real answer is usually buried in the call recordings.

I once listened back to a series of calls for a deal we lost.
It wasn't about our product.

A competitor had successfully created doubt about our implementation process on the very first call. We spent the next three calls trying to recover, but the damage was done.

That single insight was more valuable than any report I could have bought.

Your competition is talking about your company every day.
Your prospects are recording it for you.

I've watched PMMs(including myself) spend months perfecting messaging frameworks, only to hear their sales teams pitch something completely different three weeks later.

A recent Forbes analysis confirmed what I've observed across dozens of B2B companies: messaging doesn't fail because it's poorly written. It fails because it's built in isolation from the people who actually use it.

The breakdown happens in three predictable stages:

1. Marketing creates messaging based on competitive research and persona assumptions
2. Sales teams find the language doesn't match how customers actually talk about problems
3. Everyone defaults to whatever feels natural in the moment

Most companies respond by tightening controls. More slide decks. Stricter review processes. Mandatory certification.

But this misses the fundamental issue: messaging built from assumptions will always require enforcement. Messaging built from customer reality doesn't.

In my experience building sales enablement systems, the most consistent messaging comes from companies that start with customer conversations, not conference room brainstorms.

The shift isn't about better distribution. It's about better sourcing.

I stopped trusting most "Voice of the Customer" reports.
Here's why.

For years, I thought VoC was about surveys, interviews, and focus groups.
I was asking customers for their opinion.

But solicited feedback is biased. It's what people *think* they feel, not how they *actually* behave when solving a problem.

My perspective shifted when I started analyzing what customers were saying organically in our sales calls. The unfiltered language they used to describe their problems was more valuable than any survey response.

The real Voice of the Customer isn't in a report.
It's in your call recordings.

You just have to build a system to listen.

### **June 12, 2025**

The most important insights about your business are being shared every day.
And your strategy team isn't there to hear them.

They happen in your sales calls.

I've seen it over and over in my career.
A critical piece of customer feedback starts its journey:

→ From the customer's mouth...
→ To the sales rep's memory...
→ To a one-line summary in a CRM field...
→ To a manager's secondhand report...
→ And finally, to the strategy team, weeks later.

By then, the signal is gone. The nuance is lost.

Your GTM strategy is only as good as the raw data that feeds it.
If your feedback loop is slow, manual, and lossy, so is your ability to adapt.

### **June 10, 2025**

AI call summaries are the new productivity hack.
They're also becoming a strategic trap.

I see teams adopt them and celebrate the time saved on meeting notes.
It feels productive.

But a summary is not an insight.
It tells you what happened in one room, on one day.

It doesn't tell you the trend.

Real intelligence isn't finding out that one customer mentioned your competitor.
It's discovering that your competitor was mentioned in 40% of your losses this quarter.

That's the signal that matters.

One saves you 15 minutes.
The other saves your GTM strategy.

My focus is on the second one.
