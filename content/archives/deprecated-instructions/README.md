# Deprecated Instruction Files

**Date Deprecated:** July 23, 2025

These files have been consolidated into the **MASTER-CONTENT-GENERATOR.md** system and are no longer used for content generation.

## Deprecated Files:

1. **CLAUDE-CONTENT-GENERATOR.md** - Original content generation prompts
2. **blog-instructions.md** - Blog writing guidelines 
3. **linkedin-instructions.md** - LinkedIn post instructions
4. **blog-post-template.md** - Blog post structure template
5. **linkedin-post-template.md** - LinkedIn post template
6. **ANTI-DUPLICATION-WORKFLOW.md** - Original anti-duplication process

## Replacement System:

All functionality has been consolidated into:
- `/content-manager/MASTER-CONTENT-GENERATOR.md` - Complete content generation system
- `/content-manager/CLAUDE.md` - Content-manager specific Claude Code instructions

## Why Deprecated:

These files created instruction fragmentation where Claude Code might reference some files but miss others, leading to inconsistent content quality and bypassed anti-duplication checks.

The new master system ensures:
- Single source of truth for all content instructions
- Mandatory anti-duplication protocols that cannot be bypassed
- Complete quality standards in one comprehensive file
- Simplified workflow with no risk of missing critical instructions

**Do not reference these files for new content generation.**
