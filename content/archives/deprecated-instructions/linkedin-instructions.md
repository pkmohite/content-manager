## Content Strategy Guidelines

### **Content Types**

#### LinkedIn Posts - Optimized for Virality
- **Framework-driven content** that professionals want to save and reference
- **Contrarian insights** that challenge conventional B2B sales wisdom
- **Actionable takeaways** that readers can immediately implement
- **Shareable observations** that spark professional discussion and debate
- **Personal building stories** that provide behind-the-scenes credibility
- **Enterprise procurement insights** leveraging family background in multi-million dollar purchasing decisions
- **Industry predictions** that position you ahead of trends

#### Blog Articles
- In-depth analysis of B2B sales and marketing trends
- Product marketing strategies and frameworks
- AI implementation insights and technical deep-dives
- Startup and entrepreneurship lessons from building Proponent
- Underground insights from whisper networks and private industry conversations

#### Reference Materials
- Industry reports and competitive research
- Sample content from industry leaders
- Technical positioning and messaging frameworks

### **Viral Content Guidelines**
1.  **Create Shareability**: Every post should contain insights that professionals want to share with their networks
2.  **Build Reference Value**: Include frameworks, models, or takeaways that readers will save for future use
3.  **Vary Your Endings**: Mix different closing styles - definitive statements, provocative observations, calls to action, or just stop after the insight. **AVOID formulaic questions that scream "AI-generated"**
4.  **Provide Immediate Value**: Readers should gain actionable insights they can apply within 24 hours
5.  **Challenge Convention**: Take contrarian positions on accepted industry practices
6.  **Use Concrete Examples**: Include specific scenarios that readers can relate to their own experiences
7.  **Surface Hidden Truths**: Focus on what people discuss privately vs. publicly - whisper network insights
8.  **Avoid Obvious Topics**: Don't just web search "viral content" - use creative research strategies
9.  **Style Variability**: Mix post types - analytical frameworks, emotional rants, short observations, detailed stories. Not every post needs to be 400 words or follow the same structure

### **Standing Instructions**
1.  LinkedIn post drafts go into `content/drafts/linkedin-drafts/` with date-based filenames
2.  Always offer at least 3 options with a brief description of the proposed narrative before drafting
3.  Strictly avoid using hashtags, colorful emojis or SEO jargon in the posts
4.  **NO MARKDOWN FORMATTING** - LinkedIn doesn't support it (no **bold**, no ##headers, no →arrows)
5.  Use simple bullet points (•) and plain text formatting only
6.  Focus on strategic insights over tactical features when discussing Proponent
7.  Use specific technical terminology (e.g., "Large Language Models" vs. "AI") to demonstrate sophistication
8.  **Test for virality**: Ask "Would I share this with my professional network?" before publishing
9.  **Prioritize value over length**: Well-structured valuable content (300-500 words) often outperforms short generic posts
10. **Mobile-optimized structure**: Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and clear frameworks for scanability

### **Advice for the copywriter:**
Prashant has refined his writing style through multiple iterations. Here are the key principles derived from his recent edits:

1.  **Conversational & Collaborative Tone:** Use inclusive openings that invite readers into the conversation (e.g., "Let me know if this sounds familiar"). Replace instructional language with collaborative framing using phrases like "We need to..." This creates a shared journey rather than talking at the reader.

2.  **Conciseness Over Verbosity:** Tighten copy by combining paragraphs and removing unnecessary connecting phrases. Focus on the most critical and impactful words. Every sentence should serve a purpose—be direct and punchy.

3.  **Strong, Definitive Takeaways:** Make conclusions feel certain and powerful. Use definitive language (e.g., "Deep pain gets you **the** deal" rather than "a deal"). End posts with memorable, quotable statements.

4.  **Conceptual Over Tactical:** Elevate the narrative by describing the *what* and *why* at a strategic level rather than focusing on tactical details. Use philosophical assertions that position human ingenuity as irreplaceable while defining AI as an augmenter of human intelligence.

5.  **Technical Specificity:** Move from general terms like "AI" to specific technology references like "Large language models." Explain *how* technology achieves its goals to add credibility and clarity.

6.  **Personal Storytelling:** Use specific, relatable moments from building the company to illustrate broader principles. Connect small details (like font weights) to larger philosophies about culture and craft.

7.  **Procurement Insider Perspective:** Leverage unique family background - father's 30+ years as procurement executive at major Indian conglomerate provides authentic enterprise buyer insights that most sales content lacks. Use phrases like "My father spent 30 years buying enterprise software" or "Having grown up hearing procurement stories" to introduce authentic buyer psychology insights.

8.  **Balanced Product Mentions:** When discussing Proponent, focus on the strategic problem being solved rather than individual features. Make it feel like a natural extension of the insight, not a sales pitch. Emphasize the AI-first architecture and comprehensive intelligence capabilities that differentiate us from traditional conversation intelligence tools.

## Content Calendar Guidelines

### **Posting Schedule**
- Target: 3-4 LinkedIn posts per week
- Recommended days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-topic.md` (e.g., `2025-07-23-ai-first-sales-platform.md`)
- Content mix: 70% thought leadership, 20% personal insights, 10% direct Proponent positioning

### **Content Themes to Rotate**
1. **AI-First Sales Intelligence**: Technical positioning and capabilities
2. **Strategy-to-Execution Gap**: Core problem Proponent solves
3. **Founder Insights**: Personal stories from building the platform
4. **Industry Analysis**: B2B sales and marketing trends
5. **Customer Intelligence**: Voice of customer and conversation analytics
6. **Underground Realities**: What sales teams say privately vs. publicly
7. **Implementation Horror Stories**: Real AI tool failures and disasters

### **Post Style Variations (Mix These)**
1. **Framework Posts** (300-400 words): Structured insights with clear hierarchies and takeaways
2. **Emotional Rants** (150-250 words): Passionate reactions to industry problems or bad practices
3. **Short Observations** (50-100 words): Brief, punchy insights that make people think
4. **Story-Driven Posts** (250-350 words): Personal anecdotes that illustrate broader principles
5. **Contrarian Takes** (200-300 words): Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence
6. **Data-Backed Insights** (200-300 words): Use statistics to support surprising conclusions

### **Ending Variations (Avoid Repetitive Questions)**
- **Definitive Statement**: "That's the difference between AI tools that get adopted and AI tools that get abandoned."
- **Provocative Observation**: "Most 'conversation intelligence' is just expensive call transcription."
- **Call to Action**: "Stop optimizing for the conversations you can see. Start thinking about the ones you can't."
- **Personal Reflection**: "This is why I'm building Proponent differently."
- **Just Stop**: End after delivering the insight without forcing engagement

## Proponent-Specific Positioning Guidelines

### **Key Differentiators to Emphasize**
- **AI-Native vs. Retrofitted**: Proponent is built from the ground up with AI capabilities, unlike traditional tools that added AI features later
- **Strategic vs. Tactical**: We analyze conversations across entire pipelines for strategic insights, not just individual call summaries

- **Evidence-Based vs. Assumption-Based**: GTM strategies grounded in actual customer language from conversations

### **Technical Terminology to Use**
- "Large Language Models" (not just "AI")
- "Conversational Intelligence Platform" (not "call recording tool")
- "AI-First Architecture" 
- "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)"
- "Real-Time Sales Coaching"
- "Strategic Pipeline Intelligence"
- "Voice of Customer Analytics"

### **Competitive Positioning**
- **vs. Gong/Chorus**: Strategic intelligence vs. tactical summaries
- **vs. Sales Enablement Platforms**: Dynamic, AI-powered recommendations vs. static playbooks
- **vs. CRM Analytics**: Conversation-driven insights vs. activity metrics

### **Problem Framing**
- Focus on the "strategy-to-execution gap" in B2B sales
- Emphasize the disconnect between customer needs and sales execution
- Highlight the challenge of scaling successful sales behaviors across teams
- Address the difficulty of extracting actionable insights from hundreds of conversations

**Tone Guidelines:**
- Be observational and collaborative, not authoritative
- Use "I think" and personal perspectives to make insights feel approachable
- Avoid prescriptive language unless offering actionable advice
- Always look for opportunities to tighten copy for maximum impact
- Balance technical sophistication with accessibility
- Use specific examples from building Proponent to illustrate broader principles
