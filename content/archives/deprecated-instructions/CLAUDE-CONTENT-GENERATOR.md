## üéØ Quick Content Generation Prompts

### **For LinkedIn Posts (Use when you need 2-3 posts per week)**

#### **Standard Content Generation Prompt**
```
Generate a LinkedIn post for Proponent following these guidelines:

‚ö†Ô∏è ANTI-DUPLICATION CHECK (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):
Before generating content, you MUST:
1. Search /content-manager/CONTENT-MASTER-INDEX.md for similar keywords and themes
2. Review /content-manager/content/drafts/ideas-backlog.md for topic usage status
3. Check content relationship mapping for related content clusters
4. If overlap found, either choose different angle/audience/depth or select different topic
5. Reference similar content to ensure differentiation

CONTEXT:
- I'm Prashant Mohite, CEO/Co-founder of Proponent
- Proponent is an AI-first conversational intelligence platform
- Target audience: VP Sales, Revenue Operations, Product Marketing Managers
- Tone: Conversational, insightful, evidence-based (see my writing style in /content-manager/references/style-references/)

VIRAL OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Create shareability: Include insights professionals want to share with their networks
- Build reference value: Add frameworks/takeaways readers will save for future use
- Spark discussion: End with questions that encourage meaningful professional debate
- Provide immediate value: Readers should gain actionable insights they can apply within 24 hours
- Challenge convention: Take contrarian positions on accepted industry practices
- Use concrete examples: Include specific scenarios readers can relate to
- Surface hidden truths: Focus on what people discuss privately vs. publicly
- Use creative research: Avoid generic web searches, dig deeper with alternative strategies

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use my writing style from published examples in /content-manager/content/published/linkedin-posts/
- Follow content pillars: AI-First Sales Intelligence (30%), Strategy-to-Execution Gap (25%), Founder Insights (20%), Industry Analysis (15%), Customer Intelligence (10%)
- Use varied post structures: frameworks, rants, observations, stories - avoid formulaic patterns
- End naturally: definitive statements, provocative observations, or just stop after the insight
- **NEVER end every post with a question** - this screams AI-generated content
- No hashtags, minimal emojis
- Prioritize value and depth over brevity (300-500 words is fine for valuable frameworks)
- 3-8 short paragraphs with clear structure for mobile scanability
- IMPORTANT: NO MARKDOWN FORMATTING - LinkedIn doesn't support it (no **bold**, no ##headers, no ‚Üíarrows)
- Use simple bullet points (‚Ä¢) and plain text formatting only

TOPIC: [Specify your topic here, e.g., "Real-time AI coaching vs post-call analysis"]

BEFORE FINALIZING:
- Confirm topic is not marked [USED] in ideas-backlog.md
- Verify unique differentiation from similar content in master index
- Update ideas-backlog.md with [RESERVED] status if selecting from backlog

Create filename as: YYYY-MM-DD-topic-keywords-LINKEDIN-READY.md
Save to: /content-manager/content/drafts/linkedin-drafts/
```

#### **Framework-Based LinkedIn Post Prompt**
```
Create a LinkedIn post featuring a framework or model for B2B sales/marketing professionals.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Original framework with 3-5 levels/stages/categories
- Personal insight from building Proponent
- Actionable takeaways for readers
- Question that encourages professional discussion

```
Generate a comprehensive blog post (3,000+ words) for Proponent thought leadership.

‚ö†Ô∏è ANTI-DUPLICATION CHECK (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):
Before generating content, you MUST:
1. Search /content-manager/CONTENT-MASTER-INDEX.md for similar keywords and themes
2. Review /content-manager/content/drafts/ideas-backlog.md for topic usage status
3. Check existing blog drafts for framework overlap
4. Verify no similar LinkedIn posts cover the same ground at different depth
5. If overlap found, either choose different angle/audience/framework or select different topic

CONTEXT:
- Review my existing blog posts in /content-manager/content/published/blog-posts/
- Follow the framework approach from successful posts like "AI Sales Coaching Hierarchy"
- Target: B2B sales and marketing professionals seeking strategic insights

REQUIREMENTS:

## üîÑ Content Generation Workflow

  - `site:reddit.com` + specific pain points/complaints
  - `site:news.ycombinator.com` + critique/problems/limitations
  - Search for failure stories, resistance patterns, implementation disasters
  - Look for "what people actually said" vs "overheard in meetings"
  - Search for founder horror stories, tool failures, "wasted money on"
  - Focus on whisper network topics, private conversations, underground realities
- **Reference ideas from**: `/content-manager/content/drafts/ideas-backlog.md`

  - **Blog Posts**: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-keywords-BLOG-READY.md`
  - **Date Format**: Use intended publication date
  - **Topic Keywords**: 2-4 descriptive words separated by hyphens
- Save to appropriate drafts folder (`linkedin-drafts/` or `blog-drafts/`)
- Update `/content-manager/SIMPLE-POSTING-SCHEDULE.md` with new content
- Move to published folder after posting (remove `-READY` suffix when published)

### **Alternative Search Strategies (Use Instead of Generic Web Searches)**

- "founder burning cash on" OR "wasted money on sales tool" disaster
```

#### **Whisper Network Insights**

# Search Examples:
- "sales team actually said" OR "overheard in sales meeting" horror stories
- "everyone is talking about" "but nobody says" private conversations
- B2B sales whisper network private reality check
- "what sales reps really think" OR "private slack channels"
```

#### **Implementation Reality Check**
```
# Search Examples:
