# Master Content Generator - Proponent
**The only file Claude Code needs to generate high-quality, non-duplicated content**

**Last Updated:** July 23, 2025

## üö® MANDATORY FIRST STEP: ANTI-DUPLICATION PROTOCOL

**Before generating ANY content, Claude Code MUST complete this checklist:**

### **Step 1: Search Existing Content**
- [ ] **Search** `/content-manager/CONTENT-MASTER-INDEX.md` for similar keywords and themes
- [ ] **Review** content relationship mapping for related clusters  
- [ ] **Check** target audience distribution to avoid oversaturation
- [ ] **Verify** content pillar balance remains within targets

### **Step 2: Ideas Backlog Review**
- [ ] **Check** `/content-manager/content/drafts/ideas-backlog.md` for topic status
- [ ] **Verify** topic is not marked `[USED]` or `[PARTIALLY USED]`
- [ ] **Review** content relationship mapping section
- [ ] **Confirm** topic adds unique value if similar content exists

### **Step 3: Differentiation Validation**
If similar content exists, ensure:
- [ ] **Different content depth** (Surface/Detailed/Framework)
- [ ] **Different content angle** (Framework/Story/Rant/Data/Analysis)  
- [ ] **Different target audience** focus
- [ ] **Unique insights** not covered in existing content

**üõë STOP CONTENT CREATION if clear differentiation cannot be established**
