## üéØ Competitive Positioning Overview

### **Primary Value Proposition**
"Your very own sales AI partner" that provides "instant feedback so that your team can improve and land more deals"

### **Market Positioning**
- **Category**: "AI Copilot for Sales Teams" / Conversation Intelligence Platform
- **Primary Differentiation**: AI-first architecture built by former Google DeepMind and Apple engineers

## üî• CRITICAL INSIGHT: Public Performance Scoring Transparency Issue

### **The Performance Visibility Problem**
Glyphic openly displays sales rep performance scores and comparisons "for everyone to see" through:

- **Automated Scorecards**: AI evaluates reps on 1-5 scale across competencies
- **Team Performance Distribution**: Dashboard shows performance across the entire team
- **Public Rankings**: Managers can "quickly spot standout performers" vs struggling reps
- **Trend Lines**: Individual rep performance evolution displayed over time
- **Talk Time/Speed Metrics**: Public visibility of communication style metrics

### **Transparency Concerns & Underground Reality**
- **Sales Surveillance**: Reps likely feel monitored rather than supported
- **Performance Theater**: May encourage gaming metrics rather than authentic selling
- **Team Dynamics**: Public rankings can create toxic competition vs collaboration
- **Psychological Impact**: Constant scoring creates performance anxiety
- **"Big Brother" Effect**: Similar to CRM resistance - reps may disable or avoid features

### **What Sales Teams Really Think (But Don't Say Publicly)**
- Fear of AI judgment affecting career prospects
- Resentment toward opaque AI scoring criteria
- Preference for private coaching vs public performance displays
- Concerns about AI bias in performance evaluation
