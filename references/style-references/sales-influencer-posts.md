### Gal Aga - CEO @ Aligned 

Sales is THE MOST misunderstood and brutal role in tech. One quarter, you’re a rockstar. The next, you’re doubted, blamed, and burned out. Usually unfairly. Before hiring (or firing) another seller, read this 👇🏽 Twice.

1. You can’t hide in sales. Everyone knows exactly how you’re doing. Every. Single. Month. Don’t only measure reps on quota attainment. Give them more ways to show progress: stage conversion, ACV, sales cycle, key logos, pipeline growth.

2. AEs hear more No’s in a week than most people hear in a year. And don’t get me started on SDRs… They don’t need more pressure in your 1:1 meetings; they need genuine emotional support.

3. One bad quarter and your job might be on the line—even if it wasn’t your fault. Everyone loves you when deals close, but the moment it’s tough? They panic. Sellers don’t need your stress or your micromanagement now. Instead, show you believe in them. Give them an easy win (like a board intro) and help them get their mojo back.

4. Every seller I know has felt impostor syndrome. Even the top ones. They think, “Maybe I’m just good at selling to non-tech people?” or “Maybe my last job was easy because of the brand, and I can’t really sell.” Poor management CAN make top 1% AEs doubt themselves and fail. Manage their mental game. See them as the superstars you want them to be, and they will believe it as well.

5. Sales isn’t a vacuum or a department. Product gaps, weak messaging, zero leads—yet sales always pays the price... You can’t hire a magical AE or VP and fix everything. Get your sh*t in place first. And get EVERY team: Product, Execs, CS actively supporting deals. Build a Sales Company, not just a Sales Team. Next quarter, the same reps will perform. Guaranteed.

6. If you crush it? People think “sales must be easy.” If you struggle? People think, “Maybe they’re not that good.” Stop judging superficially. Look deeper, the devil’s in the details. Are deals stuck at a certain stage? Are they receiving a similar volume/quality of leads? What strengths did they show last quarter?

7. Sales leaders carry enormous pressure for the whole team. They’re always just one missed quarter from risk—market shifts, hiring misses, fast-scale diminishing returns. It’s GUARANTEED to happen. Give them time to find root causes. Heck, roll up your sleeves and help them. Show you understand it’s never smooth and help them get back on track. 

8. We judge CV gaps or short employments, and optimize for Oracle or Salesforce logos, ignoring that many sellers get zero support, join bad product-market-fit companies, or work outside their strengths (inbound vs outbound, ACV, full cycle vs specialist, early vs established, etc.). Identify the exact seller type YOU need. Stop chasing a ‘perfect resume’.

Sales is brutal. Wildly misunderstood.

Great sellers aren’t flawless unicorns.

Don’t punish their struggles.

Support their fight.

Watch them thrive.

I led sales teams between $1M-$100M ARR. Built 4 orgs from scratch. Made every mistake in the book. Here are the 9 hardest lessons I’ve learned about startup sales:

1. Sales is lonely, misunderstood, brutal. Build a Sales Company, not a Team.

One quarter you're a rockstar; the next, doubted. Your numbers are public. You hear more NO’s weekly than most yearly. Yet you're measured only by quota, and it's all on you. Instead, get product, execs, CS - everyone in deals. Credit reps for pipeline built, top logos, deal momentum. Great reps aren’t perfect. Support, don’t punish them.

2. Hiring ‘closers’ is the problem, not the solution

Closing is NOT a skill. Great reps don’t ‘close’, they architect deals: Map out every step, orchestrate follow-ups, and execute flawlessly. ‘Knife between the teeth’ as my old VP used to say might get some EOQ deals, but you’ll never master complex sales.

3. Enterprise reps aren’t magicians (Stop hiring Oracle AEs)

Enterprise AEs won't save the day. Hiring them means nothing if your product and brand scream SMB, if execs don't help in deals or CSMs aren’t as skilled. These hires burn cash faster than you can blink. Build first, then chase whales.

4. Customer experience isn’t a mantra. It’s your ENTIRE GTM strategy.

Unknown startups don't beat giants with tech. They win by making every AE/CSM moment feel like a partnership, every SDR/Brand touch memorable, and every buying step frictionless. This is how you unlock referrals, case studies, WOM & real growth.

5. Great sales processes are anchors, not cages

Rigid rules, strict scripts, 23 CRM validations - feel predictable but crush your team’s creativity, intuition and buyer experience. Don't micromanage every step. Define essentials, show what good looks like, and trust managers to coach, not control. Let your reps dance.

6. The real magic happens between meetings, not on calls

Most teams obsess over calls. Top AEs obsess about what happens in between. They know nothing you say matters if buyers aren’t equipped for the real selling - the one happening internally. Without you. They keep momentum, multithread, strategically follow-up, enable champions. Coach & build your process around this.

7. Enablement is your critical growth lever, yet the most misunderstood

Many companies think Enablement = fancy content management and training. It's neither. Not about ebooks, Sandler, or GDrive. True enablement helps reps unblock confused buyers, accelerate decisions, and close deals. Let them fix the buying journey, execution, and measure on Deal Velocity. Nothing less.

8. Smooth scale is a myth. All unicorn graphs you saw lie.

We see smooth unicorn growth graphs and think they're real. They're like Instagram - behind them, reality is messy. Playbooks break. Morale dips. Assumptions fail. There’s no single ‘engine’ you crack and relax, just many engines at every stage. Expect things to break, build buffers. It’s the only way to survive this ride.

What would you add?


### Erwan Gauthier - Head of Growth @lemlist
You just landed your growth job.
CEO tells you: “Outbound is not working.”

Most people rush into solutions : 

New messaging.
New tools.
New ICP.
New SDRs.

But if outbound is broken, the fix isn’t always obvious.
You need to act like a doctor. Not a mechanic.

Here’s how I approach it:

 1. What does “not working” mean?
→ No replies? No meetings? Low conversion to closed-won?
Outbound can “work” and still not generate revenue. Big difference.

 2. What has been tried so far?
→ Did they test multiple angles or send 3 emails and give up?

 3. Who’s been doing it?
→ Founders? A junior SDR? A tool with no owner? Makes a big difference.

 4. What’s the market saying?
→ Are people opening but not replying? Are replies all negative?
Read the last 100 replies and sit with them.

 5. How is the data infrastructure?
→ Are we targeting the right people? Right time? Right signals?

Only after this diagnosis do I move into fix mode.

Because if you skip the diagnosis, you’re not fixing outbound.
You’re just guessing.

Some people tell me their passion is automation

And I run

Give me a growth marketer who’s obsessed with 10 other things : music, psychology, history, streetwear, cinema - any day

Because the best ones don’t just optimize ads and workflows

They understand people
They connect dots others don’t even see
They blend ideas from many fields to spark creative solutions 

I’ve seen this over and over in hiring.

Two candidates apply for a growth role 

Candidate 1: Says their only passion is automation. They’ve mastered Zapier, APIs, and ad platforms - but think marketing is just a game of triggers and pixels.

Candidate 2: Loves automation but also spends weekends analyzing storytelling in Tarantino movies, geeking out on human behavior, and breaking down why streetwear brands create cult followings

Who do you bet on?

The first one might build decent systems. The second one? They’ll build movements.

Because growth isn’t just about automation. It’s about understanding people. 

And people are irrational, emotional, and driven by stories.

I’ll take the second candidate every single time.


### Jess Forrester - Chief Marketing Officer + GTM Leader

People don’t talk enough about the #1 cause of bad data and it’s something RevOps can’t fix on their own.

It isn’t duplicate records or decaying data or bad integrations or inconsistent data standards. 

It’s fear.

Just about every role I’ve had has included owning MOPs or RevOps — and the hardest problems were never technical. The best RevOps leaders are the first to call this out.

The marketer who talks too much about vanity metrics or stretches attribution definitions? They’re afraid.

Sales leaders who rewrite pipeline and close rate definitions to “improve” their metrics in their first 90 days? They’re afraid.

Sales reps who inflate pipeline? Or do the opposite — never calling an opp until it’s one millisecond before signature?

CSMs who underreport risk, skip churn reason fields, avoid tagging at-risk accounts? 

Great GTM leaders know this. So:
-They normalize reality in public — running deal reviews where honesty is rewarded, not punished.
-They enable the CRM as a tool for reps, not a surveillance system.
-They treat data as a tool to learn, not a weapon.
-They align incentives and build shared ownership across teams.

We’re all working to clean up our data — a prerequisite to most AI-enabled GTM. So here’s my call to action: 

Your CRM data is a mirror. You can only trust the data as much as your team trusts you

I LOVE product marketing — and it is by far the hardest marketing role. 

I feel pretty strongly that if you are a marketing leader building a team, you only have two choices:

1) You can hire an experienced product marketer. 
2) Or you can act as the experienced product marketer the team needs yourself. 

Delegating the product marketing function to a junior product marketer without significant involvement is going to fail. 

Why? 

The biggest reason is that excellent stakeholder management is non-negotiable. You need a marketer who can get themselves in the right rooms, have influence earlier than other teams realize is needed, influence market strategy and positioning, and develop launch plans that account for market timing, asset creation (including knowing exactly what they do and don't need to create assets early), and training across teams...

It is almost impossible to operate with that kind of authority without experience. Without proper support, a junior PMM is going to get steamrolled by product, sales and engineering 10/10 times.

If you’re a junior PMM, learning to borrow authority from your leaders is the fastest path to building your own.

### Charles Tenot - CEO @lemlist & lempire


I’ve worked with 5 different VPs of Sales. Here’s what separates the great from the average:

The average VP of Sales:
→ Accepts almost every candidate they interview.
→ Creates a 50-page “Sales Bible” that no one reads.
→ Spends more time on their laptop than with their team or prospects.
→ Adds endless fields to the CRM but never uses the data.
→ Thinks RevOps is simple but couldn’t do it themselves.

The great VP of Sales:
→ Rejects 50% of candidates to protect the culture.
→ Keeps raising the bar—pushing quotas when possible.
→ Lets go of both poor performers and toxic top performers.
→ Turns complex ideas into simple narratives buyers connect with.
→ Keeps processes light, focusing on what truly drives revenue.
→ Spends 80% of their time with customers or their team.
→ Works insanely hard.
→ Understand the importance of tooling by not only implement tools like lemlist but making sure teams are trained to use them, and leverage power users to inspire the rest of the team.

Being a VP of Sales is one of the toughest jobs out there.

They’re often the driving force behind top-performing companies—so finding the right one is everything.

1980–2010: CEOs were former CFOs
2010–2025: CEOs came from Sales
2025 onwards—RevOps leaders are next in line 👇

For decades, CEOs were obsessed with profitability.
That’s why the CFO was the natural heir.
Cost control, margin, predictable growth.

Then came the SaaS wave.
Everything was about growth and customer acquisition.
Sales became king.
So Sales leaders became CEOs.

But today the game is changing.
Growth is still important, but not at any cost.
Everyone talks about "efficient growth".

Tools and systems are becoming increasingly important.
Companies able to orchestrate complex workflows—like Ramp—are literally crushing their market.

And this is happening thanks to the rise of RevOps. People who:
→ Understand the full funnel, from lead to renewal
→ Know how to measure what really matters
→ Can align Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success
→ Build systems that support GTM motions and make them 5x, 10x more efficient
→ And drive cash-efficient growth

RevOps is still a relatively new function.
But someone who:
→ Strategically understands GTM motions
→ Deeply knows the systems that support the business
→ Masters the execution layer from end to end

That’s CEO material. 
Not the loudest in the room.
But the one who actually knows how everything works—and how to make it work better.

Over the next 10 years, don’t be surprised if more and more CEOs come from RevOps.

### Domitille de Saint-ExupéryDomitille de Saint-Exupéry - CMO @lemlist 

The best growth channels do 2 things:
→ Drive acquisition
→ Build awareness
Influence marketing is one of them.

Erwan & Lilibeth from our Growth team launched it at lemlist 100 days ago.

And here’s their playbook 👇

1️⃣ Test & learn
We tested 3 content formats:
→ TOFU: inspirational sales content (think face-cam videos)
→ MOFU: outbound & cold email tips (mostly cheat sheets)
→ BOFU: copy-paste tactics using lemlist (GIFs, Looms)
We worked with both high-reach sales influencers and niche creators.
The goal? Learn fast. 
Double down on what works.

2️⃣ Co-create, don’t just brief
No scripts. No templated posts.
We co-built every piece—sharing ideas, giving feedback, trading examples.
The strongest content was always personal.
Spicy takes. Cheat sheets. Real use cases. Humor.
All in their voice—not ours.

3️⃣ Build attribution that works without UTMs
No tracked links. No discount codes.
But we still needed to measure impact.
So we built a time-based attribution model:
→ Track signup spikes from direct, branded, and social traffic
→ Compare to historical baselines
→ Estimate ARR using CVR + LTV benchmarks

Not perfect. 
But consistent. 
And actionable.

After 100 days:
- 53 posts with 1.5M+ impressions
- Hundreds of qualitative comments -> nice triggers for our outbound 👀 
- 2,800 free trials with estimated $185K+ ARR
- A trusted pool of 20+ creators

So what’s next?
→ Scale volume
→ Double down on what works
→ Keep refining our model

Because in 2025, influence isn’t just branding nor just acquisition.
It’s performance marketing—with a human face.
